## [Description](https://github.com/elementalSec/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ZentaoPMS/CVE-2023-46475#description)
A Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in ZentaoPMS 18.3 allows remote attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the first name field of the 'Project' endpoint.
## [Proof of Concept](https://github.com/elementalSec/CVE-Disclosures/tree/main/ZentaoPMS/CVE-2023-46475#proofofconcept)

1. Once authenticated on the application there is a plus button on the upper right hand-side which opens a drop-down menu when clicked.

2. Once the menu has appeared, there is a button called 'Project' that when clicked will allow the user to create a new project.

3. After clicking on the new project, a small window appears asking for the management type of this project. The options being Scrum, Waterfall, Kanban, Agile +, and Waterfall +, all of which are vulnerable to this Stored XSS.

4. After choosing the management type we are brought to the 'Create Project' page. In the 'Name' field of the project we can inject malicious JavaScript code and once the project is saved the alert pop-up appears.
